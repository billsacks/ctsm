The modules here provide wrappers to constants, variables and low-level
routines in CTSM that are used by the AgSys science code in order to
make it operate consistently with the rest of CTSM. If AgSys were
plugged in to a different land model, the code in this directory would
need to be replaced by alternatives that provided the same interface but
referenced constants, variables and routines that are available in the
given host model.
