Typically, we put test directories in the directory containing the files
being tested. Here we have the test directory at a higher level. The
main motivation for this is that we don't want to put unit tests (which
use CTSM-specific infrastructure) in the science subdirectory (since the
science subdirectory is supposed to be independent of CTSM), so it makes
sense to put the tests of code in the science subdirectory at this
higher level. Then, for symmetry, we also put the tests of code in other
subdirectories at this higher level, too.
