This directory contains the science implementation of AgSys. Modules
here should not depend on CTSM data structures or routines, so that this
directory could be copied in its entirety into another land model. The
only dependencies should be on (1) other modules in this directory, and
(2) modules in the ctsm_wrappers subdirectory. The latter would be
replaced by a different set of wrappers if AgSys were imported into a
different land model.
